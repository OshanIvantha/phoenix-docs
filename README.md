### Project Abstract
CERNBox is a cloud storage synchronisation service for CERN users:
it allows syncing and sharing files on all major mobile and desktop
platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOSX, Android, iOS) aiming to provide
offline availability to any data stored in the CERN EOS infrastructure.
CERNBox is based on ownCloud, a cloud sync and share platform written in
PHP following a Model-View-Controller architecture software pattern.

This project aims to provide a prototype of a new web UI for CERNBox
that will provide an immersive user experience. To achieve this, a
milestone of this project is to provide offline manipulation of the data
from the browser. The use case is that when a user goes offline in his
browser, he could continue to work on the document and perform actions
like renaming and browsing his files. Once network is re-established,
the application will reconcile the changes in the browser cache with the
server, offering a non-disruptive work environment for the end-user.
